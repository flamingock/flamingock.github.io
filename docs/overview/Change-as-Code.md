<!-- ## 👩🏽‍💻 Flamingock and the Change-as-Code (CaC) movement
We advocate for the automation and version control of all system changes. This approach streamlines release management processes and minimises the overhead associated with configuring and maintaining systems. System changes extend beyond application version updates, encompassing all components dependent on the application.

The core principle of Flamingock is to empower application developers by enabling seamless automated releases. It achieves this by storing all changes for any component orchestrated through your application deployment, using the same language in which your software is built (currently Java, watch this space! More languages to follow! 😊). -->


## 🚀 Flamingock & the Change-as-Code (CaC) Revolution
**Automate. Version. Control.**
At Flamingock, we champion Change-as-Code (CaC)—treating every system change as code. No more manual tweaks, hidden configs, or deployment surprises. Version-controlled, automated, and auditable changes mean smoother releases, fewer errors, and less maintenance overhead.

## Why CaC? Because Changes go beyond just code
System evolution isn’t just about Application updates — it extends to all encompasing components dependent on the application (SaaS configurations, databases, API dependencies, API Gateways, etc). Flamingock ensures all components move in sync, with full traceability.

The future of deployments is automation - and Flamingock gets you there.
