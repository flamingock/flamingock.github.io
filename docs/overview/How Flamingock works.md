#  How Flamingock works?

**⚙️ Code It. Deploy It. Forget It.**  

With Flamingock, developers define any component changes (database, system changes, SaaS, etc. )  **directly in application code** using familiar programming constructs such as classes and annotations, or template-based formats like YAML. The Flamingock client library then:  

✅ **Automatically executes** changes during application startup  
✅ **Generates audit trails** for full transparency and compliance  
✅ **Keeps changes version-locked** to your application releases  

**Benefits:**  
🔹 **No more out-of-band scripts** - Changes travel with your app code  
🔹 **Cluster-safe execution** - Designed for distributed systems from the ground up  
🔹 **Native version control** - Every change is code-reviewed alongside feature development  

*Built for the modern deployment pipeline where infrastructure should be as agile as your code.*
