It expands on Mongock's support to manage Database changes to all systems, databases, technologies and configurations  (ie. Kafka, Twilio, Auth0, etc) or any user-defined scenario.

- 🧩 **Flexible migration Templates**: New mechanisms for defining changes, offering a no-code option to streamline and simplify change management.

- 🚀 **Seamless deployment**: Deploy your application and systems together, ensuring version compatibility and reducing deployment friction.

- ⚡ **GraalVM support**: Enables the compilation of Java applications into native executables for improved performance.

- 👥 **Multi-Tenant support (coming soon!)**: Designed to handle multiple tenants within the same infrastructure.

- 🔒 **Distributed Locking**: Ensures synchronized deployment of multiple service instances, maintaining consistency and preventing conflicts in distributed environments.

- 🔄 **Auditing & Rollback**: Comprehensive auditing capabilities with support for rollback of changes to ensure consistency and control.

- ☁️ **Cloud offering**: Offers a fully managed service by hosting Flamingock’s operational data on our servers, removing the need for users to set up and manage their own infrastructure whilst unlocking the full Flamingock suite of features.

- 💻 **Management Operations via a Dashboard and CLI**: Flamingock offers tools to simplify Operational management tasks. Some of these example are: List history of changes, execute Rollbacks, Undo deployment, Audit, etc. Additionally, offers a Dashboard with metrics and alerts.

- 🛠️ **Advanced Workflow Management**: Enables multiple streams of change units that can be organized to execute sequentially, in parallel, or as a combination, providing flexibility in managing complex processes.

- 🔀 **Parallel Synchronised Execution**: When workflows include parallel streams, they can be executed simultaneously by different service instances, maximizing efficiency in distributed deployments.
