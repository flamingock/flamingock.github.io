# Custom injections

Flamingock primarily adopts a code-first approach for managing migrations, which offers several advantagesâ€”one of the most powerful being the ability to inject any bean into your migration classes.

This flexibility proves especially useful in scenarios such as:

- Retrieving data from a third-party system as part of the migration process
- Leveraging Spring Data repositories to interact with your database
- Executing additional operations during the migration (e.g., sending a notification), while ensuring that the transaction is aborted if the operation fails
