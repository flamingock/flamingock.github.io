# Setup & Stages

The Flamingock **setup** organizes and executes your changes using **stages**. By default, you'll use a single stage that groups all your changes and executes them sequentially.

Flamingock processes system and legacy stages first, then user stages. Changes within a stage are executed sequentially, but execution order between user stages is not guaranteed.

---

## Setup configuration

Flamingock is configured using the `@Flamingock` annotation on any class in your application. This annotation is required for all environments â€” whether you're using the standalone runner or Spring Boot integration.

The annotation is **only** used for defining the setup (stages and their sources). No runtime configuration should be placed here.

:::info
Alternatively, you can use a YAML file by specifying `pipelineFile` in the annotation.
:::

---

## Defining the setup

Here's the default single-stage configuration:

```java
@Flamingock(
    stages = {
        @Stage(name = "main", 
               sourcesPackage = "com.yourcompany.changes")
    }
)
public class FlamingockConfig {
    // Configuration class
}
```

:::info Multiple stages (advanced)
For complex scenarios requiring independent change sets, you can define multiple stages:
```java
@Flamingock(
    stages = {
        @Stage(name = "setup", sourcesPackage = "com.yourcompany.setup"),
        @Stage(name = "main", sourcesPackage = "com.yourcompany.changes")
    }
)
```
:::

Alternatively, using a YAML file:

```java
@Flamingock(pipelineFile = "config/setup.yaml")
public class FlamingockConfig {}
```

Where `config/setup.yaml` contains:
```yaml
pipeline:
  stages:
    - name: main
      sourcesPackage: com.yourcompany.changes
```

---

## Required fields

Each stage must define:
- `name`: A unique identifier
- At least one of `sourcesPackage` or `resourcesDir`

## Stage fields

| Field            | Required            | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`           | :white_check_mark:  | Unique identifier for the stage                                             |
| `description`    | :x:                 | Optional text explaining the stage's purpose                                |
| `sourcesPackage` | :white_check_mark:* | Scanned for both code-based and template-based changes                      |
| `resourcesDir`   | :white_check_mark:* | Used for template-based changes in the resources directory                  |

:::info
You must provide at least one of `sourcesPackage`, `resourcesDir`, or both.

## Where Changes are located

- **`sourcesPackage`** refers to a source package (e.g., `com.company.init`).  
  - Template-based and code-based changes can co-exist here.
  - Default source roots: `src/main/java`, `src/main/kotlin`, `src/main/scala`, `src/main/groovy`
  - Can be customized via the `sources` compiler option.

- **`resourcesDir`** refers to a path inside `src/main/resources`.  
  - Only used for template-based changes.
  - Can be customized via the `resources` compiler option.

## Example Pipeline

```yaml
pipeline:
  stages:
    - name: user-setup
      description: User-related DB setup
      sourcesPackage: com.yourapp.flamingock.users
```

Folder view:

```
src/
  main/
    java/
      com/
        yourapp/
          flamingock/
            users/
              _0001_CREATE_USERS_TABLE.java
              _0002_ADD_INDEX.yaml
```

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

### My stage isn't picked up
- Make sure the stage has a `name` and **at least one** of `sourcesPackage` or `resourcesDir`
- Check the file path is correct and uses `/` as a separator, not `.` in YAML
- If using `resourcesDir`, make sure the file is placed under `src/main/resources/your-dir`

### No changes found in stage
- Verify that the class or YAML file is located in the expected package/directory
- For code-based changes, ensure the class is annotated with `@Change` or `@ChangeUnit`
- For template-based changes, check file names and YAML formatting

---

## Best Practices

### Placing your changes
We strongly recommend placing all your changes â€” code-based and template-based â€” in a **single `sourcesPackage`**.
  - Ensures changes are always scanned, regardless of type
  - Avoids needing two locations if one template-based change requires fallback to code
  - Keeps everything in one logical location

---

### Naming Convention for Changes
To ensure clarity and enforce ordering, we recommend naming changes using the following format:

```
_0001_CREATE_CLIENTS_TABLE.java
_0002_ADD_INDEX_TO_EMAIL.yaml
```

- `XXXX`: The execution order of the change
- `CHANGE_NAME`: Descriptive name of what the change does

This convention:
- Works across both code-based and template-based formats
- Makes the execution order obvious at a glance
- Ensures consistent naming and project hygiene

:::tip
While Java typically avoids underscores and leading digits, change units are not traditional classes. Prioritizing **readability and order** is more valuable in this context.
