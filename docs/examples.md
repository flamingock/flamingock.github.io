## Introduction

The **Flamingock Examples** repository showcases a growing collection of real-world use cases demonstrating how to use Flamingock in different environments, integrations, and technologies. Each top-level folder represents a target technology and contains one or more self-contained example projects. Each project is designed to be cloned, explored, and run as a reference or foundation for your own implementation.

## What you‚Äôll find

Within each technology folder, you‚Äôll find one or more example ‚Äãprojects that demonstrate how to configure Flamingock and apply change units in various scenarios. Each folder contains its own `README.md` with setup instructions, and each project inside has its own documentation.

| Technology Folder                                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [mongodb](https://github.com/mongock/flamingock-examples/tree/master/mongodb)     | Folder containing Flamingock CE projects using MongoDB as the audit‚Äêlog backend. Each project shows different integration scenarios (standalone Java, Spring Boot, etc.). |
| [dynamodb](https://github.com/mongock/flamingock-examples/tree/master/dynamodb)   | Folder containing Flamingock CE projects using Amazon DynamoDB for audit logging. Includes both standalone and Spring Boot examples.                                      |
| [couchbase](https://github.com/mongock/flamingock-examples/tree/master/couchbase) | Folder containing Flamingock CE projects using Couchbase as the audit‚Äêlog backend.                                                                                        |

More examples are planned ‚Äî including PostgreSQL, Redis, LocalStack, Kafka, Spring Native, multi‚Äêmodule projects, and custom runners.

## How to use the examples

Each example folder and project includes its own `README.md` with detailed setup and run instructions. In general:

1. **Clone the examples repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mongock/flamingock-examples.git
   ```  
   This repository contains all the example folders for various technologies.

2. **Navigate to the technology folder of interest**
   ```bash
   cd flamingock-examples/s3
   ```  
   Replace `s3` with the folder name for the technology you are interested in (e.g., `kafka`, `mongodb`, `dynamodb`, etc.).

3. **Navigate to a specific example project**
   ```bash
   cd s3
   ```  
   Each folder contains one or more projects. Move into the project folder that matches your use case or environment.

4. **Run the example**
   - For standalone Java applications:
     ```bash
     ./gradlew run
     ```  
   - For Spring Boot projects:
     ```bash
     ./gradlew bootRun
     ```  
   - Follow any additional instructions in the project‚Äôs `README.md`. Some examples may use Testcontainers or LocalStack; if so, ensure Docker is running on your machine.
