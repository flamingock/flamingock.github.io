# 🔒 Lock Configuration

Flamingock uses a distributed lock to ensure that changes are only applied **once and only once**, even when multiple instances of your application start simultaneously in a distributed system.

This mechanism is **mandatory** and applies in both Cloud and Community editions:

- In **Cloud Edition**, the lock is managed by Flamingock’s backend
- In **Community Edition**, the lock is stored in your configured database (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB)

## ⚙️ Configurable Properties

| Property                             | Default        | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `lockAcquiredForMillis`              | `60000` (1 min)| Time the lock remains valid once acquired. Automatically released if not refreshed. |
| `lockQuitTryingAfterMillis`          | `180000` (3 min)| How long to retry acquiring the lock if another instance holds it.         |
| `lockTryFrequencyMillis`             | `1000` (1 sec) | Interval between attempts while waiting for the lock.                      |
| `throwExceptionIfCannotObtainLock`   | `true`         | Whether Flamingock should fail if the lock can't be acquired.              |
| `enableRefreshDaemon`                | `true`         | Whether to run a background thread that periodically extends the lock.     |

## 🛡 Why Locking Matters

In distributed systems, multiple app instances may start simultaneously — but only **one** should apply pending changes. Flamingock uses locking to:

- Prevent race conditions
- Ensure consistent and safe state transitions
- Guarantee single execution of each change

> ❗️If no pending changes exist, the lock is not acquired and startup proceeds normally.

---

## 🔁 Refresh Daemon (Safety Net)

The **refresh daemon** is a background thread that extends the lock before it expires.  
It’s critical for **long-running changes** that might exceed the lock duration.

Without the daemon:

- A long-running change (e.g., 90s) could outlive a default lock (e.g., 60s)
- Another instance might acquire the lock prematurely, causing conflict

> 🔒 By default, Flamingock uses proxy-based injection guards. Before executing any injected dependency, Flamingock verifies that the lock is still valid.

If you're injecting **non-critical components** (e.g., a local list or stateless helper), you can annotate them with `@NonLockGuarded` to avoid the proxy overhead.

## 🛠 Configuration Examples

### YAML (`flamingock.yaml`)
```yaml
lockAcquiredForMillis: 120000
lockQuitTryingAfterMillis: 300000
lockTryFrequencyMillis: 2000
throwExceptionIfCannotObtainLock: true
enableRefreshDaemon: true
```

### Builder
```java
FlamingockStandalone
  .setLockAcquiredForMillis(120000)
  .setLockQuitTryingAfterMillis(300000)
  .setLockTryFrequencyMillis(2000)
  .setThrowExceptionIfCannotObtainLock(true)
  .setEnableRefreshDaemon(true)
  ...
```

## 🧠 When to Tweak Lock Settings

Most projects can use the default configuration. You may need to adjust values if:

- You expect **long-running changes** (increase `lockAcquiredForMillis`)
- You run **many app instances** and want to reduce startup wait (decrease `lockTryFrequencyMillis`)
- You want Flamingock to **fail fast** if it can't acquire a lock (keep `throwExceptionIfCannotObtainLock` as `true`)

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Keep the refresh daemon **enabled**, especially for distributed or slow-processing environments
- Avoid setting `lockAcquiredForMillis` too short if any changes might run longer
- Use `@NonLockGuarded` sparingly — only when you're sure no side-effects will occur
