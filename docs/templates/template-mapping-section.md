### How Execution and Rollback Mapping Works

In a template-based change unit (declarative format), Flamingock uses the `execution` and `rollback` sections to determine which methods to invoke in your template class.

#### Execution

- The method annotated with `@Execution` is **mandatory** for the template developer.
- The `execution` section in the declarative change unit is **mandatory** for the user.
- If the `execution` section is missing, Flamingock throws an exception at startup.

#### Rollback

- The method annotated with `@RollbackExecution` is **mandatory** for the template developer.
- The `rollback` section in the declarative change unit is **optional** for the user.

The behavior of rollback varies depending on the target system capabilities and the `transactional` flag:

> For detailed information on transaction behavior, see [Transactions](../flamingock-library-config/transactions.md).

**Rollback during execution failure**

**For transactional target systems** (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB):
- **With `transactional = true` (default)**: Flamingock relies on the system's native transaction handling for automatic rollback. The `@RollbackExecution` method is NOT called.
- **With `transactional = false`**: Flamingock will call the `@RollbackExecution` method if the user provides a `rollback` section in the declarative file.

**For non-transactional target systems** (e.g., Kafka, S3, REST APIs):
- **The `transactional` flag is ignored** - behavior is always the same:
- Flamingock will call the `@RollbackExecution` method if the user provides a `rollback` section in the declarative file.
- If no rollback config is provided, Flamingock skips the method call and logs the change as **FAILED**.

**Rollback during Undo operations (manual reversion via CLI)**

- If a `rollback` section is present in the declarative file, Flamingock will call the `@RollbackExecution` method regardless of target system type.
- If no `rollback` is provided, Flamingock skips the rollback logic, but still marks the change as **ROLLED_BACK** in the audit.

:::note 
In undo operations, if rollback is not defined in the declarative file, the change is marked as reverted even though no actual rollback was executed. Itâ€™s up to the user to ensure reversibility when needed.
