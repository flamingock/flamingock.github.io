# Flamingock Documentation


**Flamingock** brings *Change-as-Code (CaC)* to your entire stack.  
It applies **versioned, auditable changes** to the external systems your application depends on — such as schemas, message brokers, databases, APIs, cloud services, and any other external system your application needs.  

Unlike infrastructure-as-code tools, Flamingock runs **inside your application** (or via the **CLI**).  
It ensures these systems evolve **safely, consistently, and in sync with your code at runtime**.  

👉 For a deeper explanation, see the [Introduction](./get-started/Introduction)

## 🔎 What It Looks Like

A simple change in Flamingock:

```java
@Change(id = "create-users-collection", author = "dev-team")
public class _0001__CreateUsersCollection {
    @Apply
    public void apply(MongoDatabase db) {
        db.createCollection("users");
    }
}
```

*When your app starts, Flamingock applies this change and records it in the Audit Store.*
