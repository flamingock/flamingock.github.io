Lack of auditability Regulatory and security teams require a full record of “what changed, when, and who made it.” Spreadsheets and one-off commands don’t cut it. Inefficient collaboration Developers, operations, and security need a single source of truth: change definitions in code, reviewed and versioned via pull requests. Increased risk of human error Pasting commands into a console or clicking UI checkboxes invites typos, misconfigurations, and stress during deployment windows.

","version":"1.0.0","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Getting started​","type":1,"pageTitle":"FAQ","url":"/docs/resources/faq#getting-started","content":" Should I use a template-based or code-based ChangeUnit? Choose template-based ChangeUnits to eliminate boilerplate for common tools and integrations (SQL DDL, SaaS/API, etc) and for your custom ChangeUnits by defining changes declaratively in YAML or JSON. Use code-based ChangeUnits when you need custom or conditional logic in Java. See: Template introduction  Can I integrate Flamingock into a Spring Boot application? Yes, you can. You just need to import the Spring Boot integration module and annotate you main application with @EnableFlamingock. See: Spring Boot integration  Can I use Flamingock without Spring Boot? Yes. You can use Flamingock in any Java application by configuring it manually using the FlamingockBuilder. This approach is ideal for applications that do not rely on Spring Boot or that require finer control.  What Java version is required? Flamingock’s core engine runs on Java 8 and above. However, some optional integration modules (such as the Spring Boot support) target more recent ecosystems and require Java 17+. For those cases we publish two artifacts:  A modern module (e.g., flamingock-springboot-integration) built for Java 17+ and Spring Boot 3.xA legacy counterpart (e.g., flamingock-springboot-integration-v2-legacy) compatible with Java 8 and Spring Boot 2.x  Most users on Java 8 can stick with the core and legacy integrations; if you’re on Java 17 or newer, simply use the up-to-date modules.  Is it possible to use Flamingock in GraalVM native images? Yes, Flamingock provides a dedicated GraalVM integration guide. Ensure your dependencies and reflection requirements are correctly configured.    ","version":"1.0.0","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Editions and compatibility​","type":1,"pageTitle":"FAQ","url":"/docs/resources/faq#editions-and-compatibility","content":" What edition of Flamingock should I use? Flamingock is available in three flavors—pick the one that best fits your needs and operational model:  Cloud Edition (SaaS) A fully managed, enterprise-grade service hosted by Flamingock: Zero ops: no infrastructure to manage, no database to configureEnterprise features: cross-service dashboards, RBAC, team &amp; environment management, fully support for templates, batching, etc.24×7 support &amp; SLAs and seamless upgrades Perfect for teams that need scalability, governance, and out-of-the-box observability. Self-hosted Edition All the same features as our Cloud Edition—dashboards, governance, transaction protocols—but deployed into your own infrastructure (on-premises or in your VPC): Full feature parity with SaaS CloudData residency &amp; compliance: you control where audit records live Ideal for organizations that require enterprise capabilities but cannot—or prefer not to—consume a hosted SaaS. Community Edition Open-source, self-hosted library you run alongside your application: Lightweight &amp; free: you supply your own audit store (MongoDB, DynamoDB, Couchbase, etc.)Core capabilities: ChangeUnits, audit logging, distributed locking, and transactional consistency where supported Perfect for smaller teams or projects that need a robust, code-centric change framework.  Can I switch between editions? Yes. Flamingock provides an importer that allows you to migrate seamlessly from a Community Edition to the Cloud Edition, making it easy to adopt a fully managed backend for storing internal data.  If you are working with different Community Editions that use the same underlying store (such as MongoDB), and they share the same structure and collection for storing metadata, it is possible to switch between them with minimal adjustments. This enables flexible integration depending on your preferred access layer, such as switching from the MongoDB Java Driver edition to the Spring Data edition.    ","version":"1.0.0","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Behaviour and execution​","type":1,"pageTitle":"FAQ","url":"/docs/resources/faq#behaviour-and-execution","content":" Does Flamingock guarantee idempotent execution? Yes. Each ChangeUnit has a unique ID and Flamingock ensures it runs only once per system, even across multiple instances.  What happens if a ChangeUnit execution fails midway? Flamingock's behavior depends on your recovery strategy configuration:  With MANUAL_INTERVENTION (default):  Transactional changes: Database automatically rolls back, issue logged for manual reviewNon-transactional changes: @RollbackExecution method called, issue logged for manual reviewResolution required: Use CLI (flamingock issue get, then flamingock audit fix) to resolve after investigation  With ALWAYS_RETRY:  Transactional changes: Database automatically rolls back, automatic retry on next executionNon-transactional changes: @RollbackExecution method called, automatic retry on next executionNo manual intervention: Continues until successful  This intelligent failure handling prevents silent data corruption and provides operational control.  How can I ensure changes are transactional? If your database supports transactions (e.g. MongoDB ≥ 4.0 in replica set), you can enable them using Flamingock’s transaction config.  Should I implement the @RollbackExecution method in transactional environments?  Yes, we highly recommend to implement the @RollbackExecution method. The main reason for this is that some other operations like undo, rely on this method to work. However it's a very good practice as it provides a robust system that is less affected when moving to non-transactional environments.  Can I react to the execution of Flamingock from my application? Yes. Flamingock provides an event system that allows your application to listen to key lifecycle moments, such as when a ChangeUnit starts or finishes execution. These events can be used to trigger logging, monitoring, or other side effects external to the change execution logic itself.  This enables loose coupling between Flamingock’s core execution and your application-level behaviour, without modifying the ChangeUnit directly.  For more details, see the Events guide.  Is Flamingock compatible with Spring Boot profiles? Yes. You can conditionally run ChangeUnits using @Profile, allowing changes to vary by environment.

You can define these directly in the config using dedicated properties (e.g. mongodb.writeConcern.w, readPreference, etc.). Refer to the extra configuration section for detailed examples.  Can I inject Spring beans or other services into my ChangeUnits? Yes. Flamingock supports full dependency injection in both Spring and non-Spring environments.  Can I define ChangeUnit dependencies and execution order? Yes. ChangeUnits can declare dependencies via annotations or configuration metadata. See ChangeUnit deep dive for more.

Flamingock is the direct evolution of Mongock. While it inherits the core idea of tracking and executing changes reliably, Flamingock is a complete architectural and conceptual redesign aimed at overcoming the limitations of Mongock.  Some of the key advancements introduced by Flamingock include:  Cloud-native capabilities: Support for cloud-managed storage and execution, enabling Flamingock to run in distributed, serverless, or ephemeral environments without additional setup.Execution stages and pipelines: A structured way to group and orchestrate ChangeUnits by context, environment, or lifecycle stage.Modular architecture: Clean separation of core, editions, templates, and integrations, enabling better extensibility and maintainability.Template-based ChangeUnits: An additional declarative mechanism to define reusable changes without writing Java code, accelerating development and standardisation.  While Flamingock retains conceptual compatibility with Mongock, it represents a significant leap forward in flexibility, scalability, and developer experience.  If you are currently using Mongock, we encourage you to review the migration guide and explore what Flamingock can offer in modern change management.    ","version":"1.0.0","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Recovery Strategies & Safety​","type":1,"pageTitle":"FAQ","url":"/docs/resources/faq#recovery-strategies--safety","content":" What are recovery strategies and why do I need them? Recovery strategies determine how Flamingock handles failures - the key differentiator from traditional tools that retry blindly or fail silently. You choose between:  MANUAL_INTERVENTION (default): Stop and alert for human review when uncertainALWAYS_RETRY: Continue automatically until successful for idempotent operations  This prevents silent data corruption and gives you operational control based on your risk tolerance.  When should I use MANUAL_INTERVENTION vs ALWAYS_RETRY? Use MANUAL_INTERVENTION for:  Financial transactionsUser data modificationsCritical business logicNon-idempotent operationsCompliance-sensitive changes  Use ALWAYS_RETRY for:  Cache warming operationsIdempotent API callsEvent publishing (with consistent keys)Configuration updatesIndex creationFile operations with overwrite  How do I know if my operation is idempotent? An operation is idempotent if running it multiple times produces the same result as running it once. Examples:  ✅ SET user.status = 'active' (same result every time)✅ CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS (safe to repeat)✅ File overwrite with same content❌ INCREMENT user.score (different result each time)❌ Append operations❌ Time-sensitive calculations  What is the issue resolution workflow?  Detection: flamingock issue list shows all unresolved issuesTriage: flamingock issue get provides next priority issue with guidanceInvestigation: Check target system state (not audit store)Resolution: flamingock audit fix -c change-id --resolution APPLIED|ROLLED_BACK  This structured workflow eliminates guesswork and provides complete audit trails.  Can I change recovery strategies after deployment? Yes, you can update the @Recovery annotation in your code and redeploy. Existing audit entries maintain their state, but new executions use the updated strategy.  How does Cloud Edition improve recovery without changing my code? Cloud Edition uses the same recovery strategies but provides enhanced outcomes through:  Intelligent automation: Advanced reconciliation and marker mechanismsEnhanced retry logic: Sophisticated backoff and circuit breaker patternsAutomatic issue resolution: Many failures requiring manual intervention in Community Edition are resolved automatically  Your change definitions remain identical - Cloud Edition just delivers better results.

Yes, Flamingock is designed for distributed systems. A single ChangeUnit can coordinate changes across multiple target systems (databases, APIs, message queues) while maintaining a unified audit trail and recovery strategy.  How do I ensure my team adopts Flamingock safely?  Start conservative: Use MANUAL_INTERVENTION (default) initiallyEstablish governance: Define organization-wide recovery strategy guidelinesCreate runbooks: Document investigation procedures for your changesTrain on CLI: Ensure team knows issue resolution workflowMonitor patterns: Review failure patterns to optimize strategies over time  What happens if the audit store goes down? Flamingock's safety guarantee: No business changes applied without proper audit tracking. If the audit store is unavailable:  Flamingock stops execution safelyNo changes are applied to target systemsSystem remains in safe, known stateResume automatically once audit store connectivity is restored  Can I use Flamingock in microservices architectures? Absolutely. Flamingock is designed for distributed systems:  Each microservice can have its own ChangeUnits for its domainShared audit store provides cross-service visibility (especially in Cloud Edition)CLI provides centralized operational control across all servicesRecovery strategies can be tailored per service's risk profile  What are the organizational benefits of adopting Flamingock?  Risk reduction: Prevent silent data corruption through safety-first defaultsTeam velocity: Eliminate deployment bottlenecks with autonomous change managementOperational excellence: Centralized governance with distributed executionCompliance automation: Complete audit trails and governance workflowsReduced dependencies: Teams control their domain without infrastructure dependencies  How does Flamingock support regulatory compliance requirements?
