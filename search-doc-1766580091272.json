For example, imagine your Change requires a NotificationService:  Scenario 1: If the Kafka target system provides its own notification service specifically for event streaming, and your Change belongs to that Kafka target system, Flamingock will use the Kafka-specific notification service. The target system context always wins.  Scenario 2: If your MongoDB target system doesn't provide a notification service, but you've registered one globally in Flamingock's builder, the Change will receive that global notification service. Flamingock searches the target system first, doesn't find it, then falls back to the global context.  Scenario 3: In a Spring Boot application, if neither the target system nor the global context provides the dependency, Flamingock will look for a Spring bean of that type. This allows seamless integration with your existing Spring components.  This hierarchy ensures that specialized implementations (like a Kafka-optimized notification service) are used when available, while still allowing shared services to be accessible across all Changes.

Use code-based Changes when you need custom or conditional logic in Java. See: Template introduction Can I integrate Flamingock into a Spring Boot application? Yes, you can. You just need to import the Spring Boot integration module and annotate you main application with @EnableFlamingock. See: Spring Boot integration Can I use Flamingock without Spring Boot? Yes. You can use Flamingock in any Java application by configuring it manually using the FlamingockBuilder. This approach is ideal for applications that do not rely on Spring Boot or that require finer control. What Java version is required? Flamingock runs on Java 8 and above.

","version":"1.0.0","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Behaviour and execution​","type":1,"pageTitle":"FAQ","url":"/resources/faq#behaviour-and-execution","content":" Does Flamingock guarantee idempotent execution? Yes. Each Change has a unique ID and Flamingock ensures it runs only once per system, even across multiple instances. What happens if a Change execution fails midway? Flamingock's behavior depends on your recovery strategy configuration: With MANUAL_INTERVENTION (default): Transactional changes: Database automatically rolls back, issue logged for manual review Non-transactional changes: @Rollback method called, issue logged for manual review Resolution required: Use CLI (flamingock issue get, then flamingock audit fix) to resolve after investigation With ALWAYS_RETRY: Transactional changes: Database automatically rolls back, automatic retry on next execution Non-transactional changes: @Rollback method called, automatic retry on next execution No manual intervention: Continues until successful This intelligent failure handling prevents silent data corruption and provides operational control. How can I ensure changes are transactional? If your target system supports transactions, you can use a transaction dependency in your Changes. See Flamingock’s transaction for more information. Should I implement the @Rollback method in transactional environments? Yes, we highly recommend to implement the @Rollback method. The main reason for this is that some other operations like undo, rely on this method to work. However it's a very good practice as it provides a robust system that is less affected when moving to non-transactional environments. Can I react to the execution of Flamingock from my application? Yes. Flamingock provides an event system that allows your application to listen to key lifecycle moments, such as when a Change starts or finishes execution. These events can be used to trigger logging, monitoring, or other side effects external to the change execution logic itself. This enables loose coupling between Flamingock’s core execution and your application-level behaviour, without modifying the Change directly. For more details, see the Events guide. Is Flamingock compatible with Spring Boot profiles? Yes. You can conditionally run Changes using @Profile, allowing changes to vary by environment.

Flamingock is the direct evolution of Mongock. While it inherits the core idea of tracking and executing changes reliably, Flamingock is a complete architectural and conceptual redesign aimed at overcoming the limitations of Mongock. Some of the key advancements introduced by Flamingock include: Cloud-native capabilities: Support for cloud-managed storage and execution, enabling Flamingock to run in distributed, serverless, or ephemeral environments without additional setup.Execution stages and pipelines: A structured way to group and orchestrate Changes by context, environment, or lifecycle stage.Modular architecture: Clean separation of core, editions, templates, and integrations, enabling better extensibility and maintainability.Template-based Changes: An additional declarative mechanism to define reusable changes without writing Java code, accelerating development and standardisation. While Flamingock retains conceptual compatibility with Mongock, it represents a significant leap forward in flexibility, scalability, and developer experience. If you are currently using Mongock, we encourage you to review the migration guide and explore what Flamingock can offer in modern change management.

Recovery strategies determine how Flamingock handles failures - the key differentiator from traditional tools that retry blindly or fail silently. You choose between: MANUAL_INTERVENTION (default): Stop and alert for human review when uncertainALWAYS_RETRY: Continue automatically until successful for idempotent operations This prevents silent data corruption and gives you operational control based on your risk tolerance. What is the issue resolution workflow? Detection: flamingock issue list shows all unresolved issues Triage: flamingock issue get provides next priority issue with guidance Investigation: Check target system state (not audit store) Resolution: flamingock audit fix -c change-id --resolution APPLIED|ROLLED_BACK This structured workflow eliminates guesswork and provides complete audit trails. Can I change recovery strategies after deployment? Yes, you can update the @Recovery annotation in your code and redeploy. Existing audit entries maintain their state, but new executions use the updated strategy. How does Cloud Edition improve recovery without changing my code? Cloud Edition uses the same recovery strategies but provides enhanced outcomes through: Intelligent automation: Advanced reconciliation and marker mechanismsEnhanced retry logic: Sophisticated backoff and circuit breaker patternsAutomatic issue resolution: Many failures requiring manual intervention in Community Audit Stores are resolved automatically Your change definitions remain identical - Cloud Edition just delivers better results.

However, the official templates provided by the Flamingock team are experimental, and their APIs may change before GA.

They excel in scenarios where the same type of operation needs to be repeated with different parameters, allowing you to avoid duplicating boilerplate code across multiple Changes.  Templates shine when:  You have repetitive patterns: Creating database tables, indexes, Kafka topics, S3 buckets, or API configurations that follow the same structure but with different valuesMultiple team members need to make similar changes: Templates provide a consistent, declarative way for developers to define changes without writing boilerplate codeYou want to enforce best practices: Templates encapsulate proven logic and prevent implementation inconsistencies across your changesThe change type already has a template: Why reinvent the wheel when S3, Kafka, SQL, MongoDB, or other common templates already exist?  Stick with code-based Changes when:  You have unique, one-off logic: Complex business transformations that are specific to your application and unlikely to be repeatedYou need maximum flexibility: Custom integrations or complex workflows that require full programmatic controlNo suitable template exists: When your use case doesn't match any available templates and creating a custom template isn't justified  Remember: Templates can handle any level of complexity - from simple configuration updates to sophisticated multi-step operations. The decision isn't about complexity, but about reusability and whether the pattern is worth abstracting into a declarative format.  Flamingock Templates unlock new possibilities for application evolution. Whether you're managing databases, configurations, or third-party services, templates simplify the process, though they are still experimental and not yet recommended for production use.  tip Join the Flamingock community and start building your own templates today! 🚀 ","version":"1.0.0","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"How to use Flamingock Templates","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/templates/templates-how-to-use","content":"","keywords":"","version":"1.0.0"},{"title":"Step 1: Add the Template dependency​","type":1,"pageTitle":"How to use Flamingock Templates","url":"/templates/templates-how-to-use#step-1-add-the-template-dependency","content":" Ensure your Flamingock Template dependency is included in your project.

When using template-based changes, instead of implementing a code-based file to define the logic of the change, you describe the change in a declarative format (e.g., YAML file). The structure you use will depend on the template you’re leveraging.  Create a YAML file (e.g., _0001__CreatePersonsTable.yaml) inside your application’s resources directory:  id: CreatePersonsTableFromTemplate targetSystem: &quot;database-system&quot; template: SqlTemplate recovery: strategy: ALWAYS_RETRY # Safe to retry - CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS semantics apply: | CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Persons ( PersonID int, LastName varchar(255), FirstName varchar(255), Address varchar(255), City varchar(255) ) rollback: &quot;DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Persons;&quot;   🔍 Understanding the configuration attributes​  id: Unique identifier for the change, used for tracking (same as in code-based changes).order: Execution order relative to other changes (also shared with code-based).targetSystem: Specifies which target system this change applies to - required for all template-based changes, just like code-based Changes.template: Indicates which template should be used to handle the change logic.

Template-based changes provide both structure and flexibility.
